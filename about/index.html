            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>Linking directly to a web feed like an RSS file on your website is not ideal for users.</p>
            <p>Browsers like Firefox and Chrome will show the raw XML of your feed.</p>
            <p><i>What if there was a better experience?</i></p>
            <p>With Subscribe Openly, you can link to a URL that will show buttons for all the common feed readers.</p>
            <p>When clicked, the button will take the user into a view that lets them subscribe to your feed in their preferred reader.</p>
            <p><a href="https://subscribeopenly.net/subscribe/?url=https://jamesg.blog/feed/posts.xml">Here is an example.</a></p>
            <h2>How To</h2>
